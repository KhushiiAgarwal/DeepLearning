## Time Series model using RNN
* A python project to deal with flight delay prediction over a few years.
* It utilizes LSTM to predict flight delays after feauture selection.
* The Data visualization shows an almost accurate prediction
 ### Setup
* Clone the repo in local Github.
* Use Google Colab or Install Jupyter 
* Run the **.ipnyb** file and ensure to give correct path for CSV
* Now import dataset airline-passengers.csv from already available datasets in Google Colaboratory
* If using Jupyter/Anaconda download dataset from:[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/airline-passengers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/air-passengers)
* Ensure dataset is present in same directory and specify the correct path

## Breast Cancer Prediction using ANN
* This project performs data preprocessing like One Hot Encoding, CHI square test
* It further performs cross validation and uses best result for accurate prediction of Breast Cancer
* Artificial Neural Networks is used as base Deep Learning algorithm
* 95.3% Accuracy is achieved with ANN
* A heatmap is also depicted for visualizing prediction

### Setup
* Clone the repo in local Github.
* For **.py** file install latest version or upgrade to Python3
* Install all libraries in terminal/Command Prompt (using cmd command on Windows)
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```
  ```
   pip install pandas
  ```
  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
  ```
  pip install seaborn
  ```
  ```
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
  ```
  pip install sklearn
  ```
* Ensure dataset is present in same directory and specify the correct path
